    I'm Andrew Hobby freelance designer and art director, who's been doing business as <em>Get A Hobby-Design</em> since 1998. I've recently changed my business name to simply- <em>HobbyDesign</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
    I create a wide range of designs including advertising, logos, brochures, corporate identities, website concepts, dimensional pieces, and direct mailings. Prior to freelancing, I worked at various advertising agencies in and around the Boston area.
    </p>
    <p>
    What I bring to the table is a traditional sense of brainstorming concepts specifically for a client's needs. Then taking those ideas to the computer, fine tune them, and then carrying through to the printing process - working alongside printers to get the most out of my designs to achieve the very best quality printed piece. Working with my clients every step of the way, unlike other creative companies where you'd get lost in the shuffle.
    </p>
    <p>
    With me you get more than an experienced designer with personalized service, you get someone who delivers from initial concept through fulfillment. I have access to a network of industry professionals: photographers, web designers, printers, and copywriters, with the flexibility and talent to meet all of my client's needs. And always on time and within a budget.
